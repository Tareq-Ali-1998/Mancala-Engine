# Mancala-Engine
Mancala is an ancient popular board game with many different versions and rules but they are all similar in the main idea, and this is a C++ engine that can almost defeat every human being player because it can reach a depth of 14 and more, the main search algorithm is Min-Max with Alpha-Beta pruning with a combination of coding tricks and topics to decrease the time complexity.


# Notes
Every single detail will be published here in a month as a guide on how to play the game exactly and how to use the engine.
In a year I will publish a Flutter application of this game in which players can play together online or with the application using the engine.
